## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My use of Bootstrap Grid has improved a lot, I found the layout quite easy to get right. This was my first time using an overlay div to create a hover effect - after some trial and error, I got there!

I found I had to use !important to get some of my CSS styles to take - I am assuming this is because they were clashing with the Bootstrap default variables.

### Continued development

The image overlay took me a while to get right - this is a technique I'll keep practicing.

### Useful resources

- [Image overlay](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay_title.asp) - This helped me with the image overlay. It also gave me the idea of making my background color opaque by converting it from hsl to rgba. This meant I could set the opacity to one on hover so that the white icon displayed correctly.
